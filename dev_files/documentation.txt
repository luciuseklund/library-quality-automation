1. GitHub Setup
Create a new repository to store all project-related code and documentation.
Set up a branching strategy (e.g., main, dev, feature branches).
Configure access permissions and ensure version control best practices are followed.
2. Design Architectural Diagram
Outline the end-to-end data pipeline architecture.
Define key components, including:
Data ingestion sources
Data cleaning and transformation processes
Storage solutions (database or data warehouse)
CI/CD pipeline flow
Use tools like draw.io or Lucidchart for visualization.
3. Implement Data Cleaning Application
Develop a Python application that:
Ingests raw data.
Cleans and standardizes the data (handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues).
Outputs the cleaned dataset for further processing.
4. Testing the Application
Write unit tests to validate data cleaning logic.
Conduct sample data tests to ensure expected transformations.
Log results for debugging and optimization.
5. Deployment (CI/CD Integration)
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment.
Implement GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, or another CI/CD tool.
Automate testing and deployment to a staging environment.
6. Testing Deployment & Database Integration
Trigger the pipeline to ensure data is successfully written to the database.
Validate data integrity post-ingestion.
Monitor logs for errors and inconsistencies.
7. Power BI Dashboard Development
Create a Power BI dashboard to track pipeline performance.
Include key metrics such as:
Total records processed.
Number of rows dropped during cleaning.
Data transformation success rate.
Ensure the dashboard is useful from a data engineering perspective, providing insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the pipeline.


Pipeline tool functions:

Handle empty cells – Identify and either fill missing values appropriately or remove incomplete records.
Fix incorrect data formats – Ensure consistency in dates, numeric values, and categorical text.
Correct wrong data – Use validation checks to identify anomalies.
Remove duplicates – Identify and remove duplicate records.
Prepare the data for analysis in Power BI – Ensure it is clean and structured.
